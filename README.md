# WBAT Processing
This is a repository for the MATLAB-based software used to process Simrad Wideband Autonomous Transceiver (WBAT).  This includes various steps depending on the instrument generation, including:
- Conversion of EK80 data format to EK60 data format for continuous wave acoustic data
- Automating scripts for the creation of EchoView (EV) files containing a fixed time period of acoustic recordings
- Automating scripts for the export of EchoView (EV) cell, region, and fish track data for external use (format specific for NOAA/AFSC database requirements)
